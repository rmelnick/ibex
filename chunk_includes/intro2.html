<div style="width: 40em;">
<p>For each sentence you'll decide to what degree it represents an <b>EVENT</b> (or activity) vs. a <b>STATE OF AFFAIRS</b> (or condition). For example ...
<ul><li><em>&ldquo;The Great Earthquake of 1906 struck San Francisco just after 5 a.m.&rdquo;</em></li>
<li><em>&ldquo;Someone was rude to you.&rdquo;</em></li></ul>
...are fairly clearly events, something specific that occurred, whereas...
<ul><li><em>&ldquo;Lassie was a famous dog.&rdquo;</em></li>
<li><em>&ldquo;Drugs already existed to help recovering alcoholics abstain from alcohol.&rdquo;</em></li></ul>
...describe states of affairs, rather than particular occurrences. 
This is not a simple either-or distinction; some sentences describe situations that are intermediate between pure events and pure states, for example:
<ul><li><em>&ldquo;It was raining.&rdquo;</em></li>
<li><em>&ldquo;Eve regretted telling him anything at all.&rdquo;</em></li></ul>
<p>Your task is to rate each of the following sentences on a seven-point scale, where one (1) is most clearly an event and seven (7) is most clearly a state.</p>
